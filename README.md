African Swine Fever

African Swine fever is a viral disease that has caused major issues for the swine industry in numerous countries, including China, Vietnam, the Phillipines. China, home to half of the world's pigs, has been hit the hardest by African Swine fever. Countries have resorted to slaughtering their livestock and placing bans on transport of livestock in and out of the country. The media has released news about African Swine Fever very recently, but why had this news not come out earlier when these data show the significant shifts of protein imports in numerous countries? We would like to explore whether or not African Swine Fever had a major impact on the swine industry before the media released reports in 2019 and around when this impact occured.
